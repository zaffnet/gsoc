# Contributing Guide for Mentors and Sub Orgs

## Sub Organizations

Only organization for are either financially sponsored or affiliated with
NumFOCUS can participate as a sub-org. One person should be the sub org
administrator and take responsibility to communicate with NumFOCUS and advertise
GSoC to the community of their organization.

## Mentors

To be a mentor please tell your sub-org administrator so he can give you all the
information you need to sign up.

## Project Ideas 

There has to be at least one primary mentor per project. We recommend that you
have backup mentors for students as well. A mentor can only be 'primary' for one
student but a backup for as many as he likes.

**Short Version**

Please make sure that the project can be partly completed during the summer so
that students pass the final evaluation. Please also read
the [student guide][CS]

**Long Version**

If you have a proposal,

1.  copy `YYYY/ideas/skeleton.md` to `YYYY/ideas/title-of-my-proposal.md`
    where `YYYY` is the currently year
    and `title-of-my-proposal` is a sort version of the title of your proposal.
2.  add a link to `YYYY/ideas/title-of-my-proposal.md` at `YYYY/ideas-list.md`.
3.  send a pull request with the changes at `YYYY`.
4.  [create an issue](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/issues/new)
