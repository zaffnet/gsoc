# NumFOCUS GSOC Operations

[NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/)
will apply to Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
as a umbrella organization.
[All projects/organizations supported by NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/projects/)
can participate at GSoC under NumFOCUS umbrella.
Projects/organizations not supported by NumFOCUS
can participate at GSoC under NumFOCUS umbrella
if approved by NumFOCUS board.

## NumFOCUS Administrator for GSoC

The NumFOCUS board will indicate two persons,
named in this document as **organization administrator**,
to be in charge of NumFOCUS application **for each edition** of GSoC.

The **organization administrators** are responsible for

- create the initial application for NumFOCUS to apply for GSoC
- advertise the application to **all** projects/organization supported
  by NumFOCUS
- manage NumFOCUS profile at GSoC
- request a minimum and a maximum number of slots
  that can accomodate the slots requested by each project/organization
  under NumFOCUS umbrella.
- stay in contact with sub-org admins

### How to sign up mentors

You can use google forms to sign up mentors who want to work with NumFOCUS. This
will have the advantage that we automatically have a list of all mentors and
their contact information. Mentors should be given access to numfocus mentoring
mailing list.

## Sub Org Administrators

Each project/organization under NumFOCUS umbrella for GSoC
should have one administrator.

The **sub-org admins** are responsible for

- provide a list of projects ideas to **organization administrator**
- advertise the application to the project/organization they represent
- connect users with NumFOCUS profile
- request to **organization administrator** a minimum and a maximum number of
  slots
- assign mentors and students to available slots

## Guidelines to Select Accept Students Proposals

**Note**: Slots are requested after the students submission phase ends

**Sub Orgs** will discuss and accept/reject students proposal based on:

1.  the number of slots received;
2.  if the proposal already has at least one mentor;
3.  student background and proposal.

**If** NumFOCUS received less slots than then requested the **organization
administrators** solve conflicts in slots allocation for each sub org. We will
try to assign at least one slot to each sub org.
