Congratulations! As you can see above, your proposal has been
accepted as one of the projects under NumFOCUS umbrella for the
Google Summer of Code this year. You should be pleased, you have been
selected from many very high quality applications.

In this email you will find general information being a NumFOCUS GSoC
student. You will also receive a email from your mentor with
information about working on your project soon.

1.  Good communication between student and mentor is important for
    your success at GSoC.

    If you have any problem with your relationship with your mentor,
    please contact one of the [administrators][admin]. We are here to
    help you.

2.  The coding period only starts on 30 May. For today until it we
    are at the "Community Bonding Period". During this period you
    should

    1.  Create a blog if you don't have one. We suggest that you
        use [GitHub Pages][GHP]. We have posted a [guide][guide] to
        get you started. If you have trouble we will help you. After
        you create your blog, you should send to us the link of it.

    2.  Subscribe to
        https://groups.google.com/a/numfocus.org/forum/#!forum/gsoc
        if you didn't do it yet. You can use this list for public
        general questions.

    3.  Get to know your mentors better. We recommend to schedule a
        online meeting (IRC/Google Hangouts/...).

3.  When the coding period starts you must

    1.  follow the "Schedule of Deliverables" of your proposal. It's
        OK if you need to change it a little as long as you talk with
        your mentor about it.

    2.  every two weeks, at least, write a blog post status report of
        your project. This way we and the rest of the project can see
        how you are doing and help you if need. It's good if you
        already start writing a blog post during the community
        bonding period to get in the habit.
    
    3.  [optional]
        you can use tools like https://github.com/karandesai-96/devlog
        to keep a track of your progress during the summer, this
        will also come in handy while writing your blog posts.

Good luck.
