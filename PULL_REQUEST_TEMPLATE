Hi

Thanks that you have chosen to apply for a NumFOCUS project. You can use pull
requests on this repository to work on a draft of your proposal before the
student application period begins to get early feedback.

Before you open a pull request with a draft of your proposal please make sure
that you have contacted your organization beforehand. Some organization prefer
if you communicate on their preferred channel (email/irc) and are more likely to
give you feedback then. On the [README][readme] we list the preferred contact
information of every organization and project idea.
